#cron is a tool used to automate system processes in the background. It does not
#display anything while runniing.
#you can use the following formula to remember how it works...
#you need an entry for every *, there are 5 stars. each star represents 
#a timeframe... minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week

#the cron settings we have here represent running the command EVERY 5 DAYS at 1:01 AM
# 1 minute past the hour, 1 hour, */5 means every 5th day, then * means every month, and * means every week.

# 1 1 */5 * * ${HOME}/auto-fix-qortal.sh > "${HOME}/qortal/auto-fix-01.log" 2>&1

#crontest file testing both more 'compatible' cron entry without username folder, and run every 2 minutes to test cron entry
#also removed username folder in output log, hopefully using ~/ for home/user instead. Testing...
#if this works, will modify the new 'auto-fix-GUI.cron' file to use only the 1:01 AM entry with more compabible entry, and 
#auto-fix-qortal-GUI.desktop file instead of cron entry for @reboot, so user can SEE script output.
