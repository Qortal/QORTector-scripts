# cron is a tool used to automate system processes in the background. It does not
# display anything while runniing.
# you can use the following formula to remember how it works...
# you need an entry for every *, there are 5 stars. each star represents 
# a timeframe... minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week

# the cron settings we have here represent running the command EVERY 5 DAYS at 1:01 AM
# 1 minute past the hour, 1 hour, */5 means every 5th day, then * means every month, and * means every week.

# if you have this cron, it is because your machine was determined to have a GUI, and you were switched to using GUI 
# startup method for auto-fix script, and the cron startup method was removed.
